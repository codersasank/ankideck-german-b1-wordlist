Scripts and resources used to generate the Anki deck for Goethe Institute's B1 wordlist 

## About this Deck
This deck will help you optimally prepare for Goethe Institute's B1 level German language exam.
This deck is an Anki import of Goethe Institute's Goethe Zertifikat B1 Wortliste. The original document is available [here](https://www.goethe.de/pro/relaunch/prf/en/Goethe-Zertifikat_B1_Wortliste.pdf) as a PDF.

It includes words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns etc.), and the sentences (to illustrate usage) corresponding to each word, which helps us understand how the meaning of a word might change with context. If a word is a noun, then it has been coloured depending on the gender (Pink for female, Green for neuter, Blue for male). If a word contains multiple example sentences, then each sentence has been used to form one note, resulting in repetition of the same word. This was done to keep the layout simple. The deck includes every word starting from the 16th page of the PDF till the end. The words have been arranged by their frequency in the German language corpus. It was not possible to fetch the frequency for a small percentage of the words. These words were sorted by the order of their importance in Goethe Institute's exams. High-frequency words for the Goethe A1 exam are more important than high-frequency words for the Goethe A2 exam, which in turn are more important than words for the Goethe B1 exam. The deck contains reversed cards as well. There are a total of 4589 notes, and 9178 cards (including reversed cards).

The translations and audio files have been borrowed from [this repository](https://github.com/aringq10/b1-goethe-anki-deck). My contribution to this was to rearrange the words based on their frequency in the corpus, and importance for the Goethe B1 exam.
